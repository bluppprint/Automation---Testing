Test Suites done using WEBDRIVERio
At the moment there are test suites that I have created using webdriverIO. 
One is a search functionality for "http://emag.ro", the second one is the search functionality for a job search engine "http:peviitor.ro" where I volunteer as a manual tester. And with the third one I am trying to test the sign up functionality for "http:theodinproject.ro".
At the moment all 3 are work in progress, and I am going to create more suites for various projects.
